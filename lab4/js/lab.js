// Creating a Hangman game:
// Choose the word
// The game selects a word that the player needs to guess. The player doesnâ€™t know what the word is.
// Show the player the blanks
// The game displays a series of blank spaces representing each letter in the word. The player will know how many letters there are in the word based on the amount of blanks.
// Player guesses a letter
// Check if the guess is correct
// If the guessed letter is in the word, the game reveals where that letter appears in the word.
// If the guessed letter is not in the word, the game counts it as a wrong guess and updates a visual (drawing a part of the hangman).
// Repeat until win or loss
// If the player guesses all the letters in the word before making too many wrong guesses, they win.
// If the player makes too many wrong guesses (usually 6 wrong guesses will draw the full hangman), they lose the game.
// End the game
// If the player wins, the game shows a success message.
// If the player loses, the game reveals the correct word.
