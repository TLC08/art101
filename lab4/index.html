			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The idea of this lab was to learn how to pseudocode things such as everyday tasks and simple computer games and add it as comments to a javasscript file.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Since this was our first time looking at a javascript file, it took us some time to figure some stuff out; we had to figure out what was an author block/header file. We decided to ask ChatGPT about it. Everything else in the assignment was pretty straightforward.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went fairly well. Kimberly decided to do the pseudocode for an everyday task and Trevor decided to do the pseudocode for a simple computer game. Kimberly did "How to Draw a Chair" and Trevor did "Hangman."</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
<pre><code>
Drawing a chair:
1. Collect your materials
	a. Sketch book, pens, pencils, erasers
2. Find your subject chair (can be any chair)
3. Position the chair in any way you like
	a. Sunlight or artificial light can be hitting it, can be placed at an angle
4. Observe the chair
	a. Pay attention to the chair's design - the curves, the surface, and how much detail certain parts of the chair has
5. Create an outline sketch of the chair
	a. Doesn't have to be detailed, jot down main features, like the legs, base, and back
6. Shade in your sketch
	a. Lightly shade the parts where the light hits the chair, but shade the shadows darker
7. Trace the outline of the chair with a pen (any pen)
8. You are done!

// Creating a Hangman game:
// Choose the word
	// The game selects a word that the player needs to guess. The player doesnâ€™t know what the word is.
// Show the player the blanks
	// The game displays a series of blank spaces representing each letter in the word. The player will know how many letters there are in the word based on the amount of blanks. 
// Player guesses a letter
// Check if the guess is correct
	// If the guessed letter is in the word, the game reveals where that letter appears in the word.
	// If the guessed letter is not in the word, the game counts it as a wrong guess and updates a visual (drawing a part of the hangman).
// Repeat until win or loss
	// If the player guesses all the letters in the word before making too many wrong guesses, they win.
	// If the player makes too many wrong guesses (usually 6 wrong guesses will draw the full hangman), they lose the game.
// End the game
	// If the player wins, the game shows a success message.
	// If the player loses, the game reveals the correct word.
