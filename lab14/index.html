          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of this lab was to use debugging tools and strategies to
            fix old assignments.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            No issues at all. All resolved before the assignments were
            submitted.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h2>Debugging</h2>
          <p>
            I didn't really end up debugging any of my code at all because I
            made sure there were no problems before I submitted the assignments.
            If anything, I just went back to tweak the design for some of them.
