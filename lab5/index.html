          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of this las was to experiment with basic JavaScript data
            types and variables.

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I didn't really have an issue completing this assignment. It just
            took me some time to understand some JavaScript things.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I felt that the assignment was pretty straightforward. I had some
            issues with some things but it wasn't even JavaScript-related. I
            referred to my partner if I had any questions to see if they could
            assist me.
