          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>The idea of this lab was to experiment with loops.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>I didn't have much trouble with the initial assignment but had some issues with doing Task X. I used
            ChatGPT to assist me in figuring out where I had went wrong with my code. Through ChatGPT's response, I 
            was able to learn new things as well.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The initial part of the assigment was okay. Doing part of it in class helped with figuring out the rest of the code. 
            When I went to do Task X, that's when I ran into some isuses. After several hours of trying to do it on my own, I was
            able to achieve some success but I ended up using ChatGPT and Wes Modes' code to help me figure it out. I was able to
            integrate my code with ChatGPT's and Wes Modes' to make it my own than just straight up copying it.
