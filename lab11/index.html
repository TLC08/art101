          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of this lab is to experiment with JavaScript Events and
            Forms.

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I didn't have much problems at all with the inital assignment. It
            was pretty straightforward.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The assignment overall was pretty straightforward. I ended up doing
            glitch effects for the page and it ended up looking pretty good. I
            did use ChatGPT for help on creating the CSS and JavaScript for it.
            I was able to tweak some of the code to get looking the way I
            wanted.
