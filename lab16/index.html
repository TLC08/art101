          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of this lab was to experiment with processing JSON from an
            API.

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I overall concept was pretty easy to understand but I came across
            some issues with accessing the comic. One of the errors I had was
            the access to the request was being blocked by CORS policy. So I
            consulted with ChapGPT providing several solutions. The solution I
            went with was trying to use the CORS proxy server. After that I ran
            into a 403 Forbidden error in which I had to follow a link in order
            to enable CORS and be able to request temporary access.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The assignment was okay. However, it was only able to work
            temporarily with the solution that I have in order to access to
            comic. It's a little frustrating but it's okay. The other solution
            was to implement a full backend server but since this is just an
            assignment for school, I'd rather just have it be simple.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>Here is the output of my program.</p>
          <p>
            If the comic does not load, please
            <a

            to enable temporary access and refresh the page.
