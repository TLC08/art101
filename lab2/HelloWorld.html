        <h1>Hello World</h1> 
        
        <p>
            We are Kimberly and Trevor. Kimberly is a third year, majoring in Art & Design: Games and Playable Media. She decided to enroll in this ART 101 class as a way to understand the relationship between technology and art on a more deeper level. Some of her hobbies are playing video games, drawing, and crocheting. Trevor is a 4th year Art & Design: Games and Playable Media major. His hobbies and interests include: illustrating, cooking, and playing video games. He wanted to take ART 101 because he was interested in web design.
