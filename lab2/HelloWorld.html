      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>
        We are Kimberly and Trevor. Kimberly is a third year, majoring in Art &
        Design: Games and Playable Media. She decided to enroll in this ART 101
        class as a way to understand the relationship between technology and art
        on a more deeper level. Some of her hobbies are playing video games,
        drawing, and crocheting. Trevor is a 4th year Art & Design: Games and
        Playable Media major. His hobbies and interests include: illustrating,
        cooking, and playing video games. He wanted to take ART 101 because he
        was interested in web design.
