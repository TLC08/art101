          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of this lab was to create a basic HTML file and CSS style
            file, edit it, view it in our browser, and inspect it.

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>No problems arose at all. It was pretty straightforward.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The lab went well. I got to know my partner a little better as we
            worked on it together in person.

            We are Kimberly and Trevor. Kimberly is a third year, majoring in
            Art & Design: Games and Playable Media. She decided to enroll in
            this ART 101 class as a way to understand the relationship between
            technology and art on a more deeper level. Some of her hobbies are
            playing video games, drawing, and crocheting. Trevor is a 4th year
            Art & Design: Games and Playable Media major. His hobbies and
            interests include: illustrating, cooking, and playing video games.
            He wanted to take ART 101 because he was interested in web design.
