        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of this lab is to create a function that depends on
            conditionals.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I just some minor issues with formatting and occassionally missing
            some text, letters, or numbers but otherwise, I didn't have much
            trouble with this lab. It was pretty straightforward.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I was able to complete the assignment with minimal to no issues at
            all. I ended up refactoring my code in the end to make it cleaner. I
            did get a little bit of help from ChatGPT to help me understand how
            I could've done it better and where I went wrong at first.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            I was able to make the function without many problems. However, I
            decided to later refactor my code so that it looks cleaner and more
            organized.
