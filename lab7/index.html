        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of this lab was to write functions that take user input.

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I didn't have issues with the intial lab itself but instead had some
            issues working on the bonus tasks. The main issue was trying to
            understand how the HTML was calliing the window prompt twice. I
            figured it out with the help of ChatGPT. So to vaguely explain, it
            seems like you're supposed to link the js file in either the head or
            in the body.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The lab was pretty straightforward because we went over it in class
            so the first part was pretty simple. However, it took me a bit of
            time to figure out how to do the bonus "Task X." I did refer to
            Wes's Lab 7 and ChatGPT for guidance.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <div id="output"></div>
          <p>
            I'm pretty satisfied with what I have. Here's the program execution:
