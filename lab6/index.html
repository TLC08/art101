        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The idea of this las was to experiment with JavaScript arrays and
            objects.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            When I checked for any problems in the console, it said I had a
            variable declared already. However, I'm not sure how that was
            possible because it was only declared once. So I haven't been able
            to figure it out but everything seems to work properly though.
            Additionally, there was an issue with the document.writeIn()
            function. Nothing seemed to output until I changed it to
            document.write(). I even asked Wesbot about it and it said
            "'writeIn' isn't a function. Maybe you meant 'write'?" and "wait is
            document.writeIn() a thing?" I found it very amusing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            The assignment was pretty straightforward besides those two issues.
          </p>
